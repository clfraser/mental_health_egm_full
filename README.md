# Self-harm in children and young people evidence and gap map (full version)

As at 21st March, this app has been published the the [Public Health Scotland website] (https://publichealthscotland.scot/population-health/mental-health/prevention-of-mental-ill-health-and-improved-wellbeing/mental-health-evidence-and-addressing-gaps/)
However, it will soon be replaced by two other evidence and gap maps at the same address. These can be found in the following repos: [mental_health_egm_stripped] (https://github.com/clfraser/mental_health_egm_stripped) and [mental_wellbeing_egm] (https://github.com/clfraser/mental_wellbeing_egm).
